Hey, im leon and heres some stuff about me!

Im a young kid and im currently only intrested in python/bat.

If i was to learn something new itd 100% be C++.

I collect retro games.

Im trying to stop relying on ChatGpt sometimes, i do tend to overuse it!

But it does help me learn and i still have a basic overview of Python/Bat.
